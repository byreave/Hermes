## Known Issues:
1. If the moonlander goes in circle(come back to the level that has been deleted once but regenerated), exits seem to have been destroyed.
2. Restart the game level may cause moonlander fail to land. (F5 to restart if this happens)
3. Launch(space) while in satellite outside of the screen will cause instantly death. (Repeatly cause reduce life function)
